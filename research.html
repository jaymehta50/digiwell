			  <h2>Shining a Light – initial findings</h2><br />
				<p>The Shining a Light Study, co-authored by members of the AirEmail team, was the first of its kind to look into the impact of digital communications on the workload and wellbeing of NHS staff. It began in 2020 with a survey of over 3,000 healthcare workers across the UK.</p>
				<p>The study examined the volume of emails received and the time spent on inbox management, both in and out of working hours, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were also asked to report on their perceived ability to manage their inboxes and how much they felt it interfered with their core work, home life, leisure time and travel.</p>

			  <h2>Focus groups – the feedback that shaped the solution</h2><br />
			  <p>Following the Shining a Light Study, 10 focus groups were set up with participants from across numerous NHS disciplines. They discussed and shortlisted the 12 features of the software tool, which was designed and developed in response to their suggestions and requirements.</p>
			  <p>Feedback from the focus groups also gave the NHS DigiWell research team key insights into how a software trial would be received and under what assurances.</p>

			  <h2>Onboarding survey</h2><br />
			  <p>An onboarding survey was rolled out to field trial participants in the NHS DigiWell Study. This involved, among other things, study participants evaluating and logging email and calendar usage before installing the Email Wellbeing tool, which allowed the research team to capture insights into the scale of participants’ digital comms workload and the challenges they encountered.</p>
