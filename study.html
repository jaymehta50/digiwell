			  <h2>The NHS DigiWell Study – measuring the problem, testing the solution</h2><br />
			  <h3>What is the study about?</h3>
			  <p>The NHS DigiWell Study was set up to determine the effectiveness of a new software solution on streamlining healthcare workers’ inbox and calendar management. The tool, Email Wellbeing, has been developed by the team behind the study with the aim of reducing time spent on emails and thereby improving digital wellbeing in the NHS.</p><br />
			  
			  <h3>What does the study involve?</h3>
			  <p>NHS staff who are eligible to take part are invited to download the Email Wellbeing add-on. Data is collected over 10 weeks, during which there will be:</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>a 2-week control period to gauge participants’ normal email usage without use of the add-on</li>
				  <li>a 2-week onboarding period in which participants familiarise themselves with the software</li>
				  <li>a 4-week intervention period when participants make use of the add-on features as part of their daily work</li>
				  <li>a 2-week after-study control period during which time participants do not use the add-on while email stats are collected.</li>
			  </ul><br />
			  
			  <h3>Who can take part in the study?</h3>
			  <p>If you work for NHS Royal Free London and meet the eligibility criteria, you are invited to take part in the study. The study is currently only open to staff from this site. To find out if you’re eligible, log in to the Take part page for full details.</p><br />
			  
			  <h3>Why is the study needed?</h3>
			  <p>Our reliance on digital communication has grown even stronger since the Covid-19 pandemic changed the way we work. Our Shining a Light Study found that 43% of NHS staff found a marked increase in work communications at that time and it’s a habit our workforce is unlikely to kick. These emails might contain urgent clinical matters – test results, clinical reports, discharge information – and are interspersed with less urgent administrative emails regarding service and staff information, and meeting requests.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12">
				<p>The risk of missing critical information and requests for action has potentially dire consequences for patients and creates additional stress for NHS workers. Being overwhelmed by the volume and pressures of email communication is one of the leading causes of technostress.</p>
			  <p>To date, the 1.4 million healthcare workers in the NHS have no digital communications and wellbeing policy in place to help them navigate and regulate the demands of a full inbox.</p>
			  <p>No time is scheduled within the working day to read and respond to emails and meeting requests, leaving workers wrestling with these pressures alongside their daily roles. Often this leads to staff dealing with urgent emails in break time and non-working hours for fear of jeopardising the delivery of high-quality patient care under their remit.</p>
